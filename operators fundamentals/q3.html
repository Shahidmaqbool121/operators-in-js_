Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript.
 Give examples of each.

Ans:- In JavaScript, operators are categorized into three groups based on the number
of operands they work with: unary, binary, and ternary operators. Here's a
differentiation between them along with examples for each: Unary Operators:
Unary operators work with a single operand, which means they operate on one
value or variable. These operators can be used for tasks like negation,
incrementing/decrementing, type conversion, and logical negation. Examples of
unary operators: Negation (Unary Minus): var x = 5; var y = -x; // y is -5
Increment (Unary Plus): var a = 3; a++; // Increment a by 1, a is now 4 Logical
NOT: var isTrue = true; var isFalse = !isTrue; // isFalse is false Binary
Operators: Binary operators work with two operands, which means they operate on
two values or variables. These operators are used for tasks like addition,
subtraction, comparison, logical operations, and more. Examples of binary
operators: Addition: var sum = 7 + 3; // sum is 10 Subtraction: javascript Copy
code var difference = 10 - 5; // difference is 5 Equality Comparison: var
isEqual = 5 === 5; // isEqual is true Logical AND: var result = true && false;
// result is false Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is the only operator
in JavaScript that takes three operands. It is often used for conditional
expressions and provides a way to create simple conditional statements in a
concise manner. Example of the ternary operator: Conditional (Ternary) Operator
(?:): var age = 20; var canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"; // If age is greater
than or equal to 18, canVote is "Yes"; otherwise, it's "No." In this example,
the ternary operator evaluates the condition (age >= 18) and returns "Yes" if
true, or "No" if false.
