Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. 
Provide examples for each category.

Ans:- Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here
are some common categories of operators along with examples for each category:
Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used for performing mathematical
operations on numeric values. Addition (+): Adds two numbers together. var
result = 5 + 3; // result is 8 Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from
another. var result = 10 - 3; // result is 7 Multiplication (*): Multiplies two
numbers. javascript Copy code var result = 4 * 6; // result is 24 Division (/):
Divides one number by another. javascript Copy code var result = 20 / 4; //
result is 5 Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation. var
result = 15 % 7; // result is 1 Comparison Operators: These operators are used
to compare values and return Boolean results. Equality (==): Checks if two
values are equal, performing type coercion if necessary. var isEqual = 5 == "5";
// isEqual is true Strict Equality (===): Checks if two values are equal without
type coercion. e var isEqual = 5 === "5"; // isEqual is false Inequality (!=):
Checks if two values are not equal, performing type coercion if necessary. var
isNotEqual = 10 != "10"; // isNotEqual is false Strict Inequality (!==): Checks
if two values are not equal without type coercion. var isNotEqual = 10 !== "10";
// isNotEqual is true Greater Than (>): Checks if one value is greater than
another. var isGreater = 8 > 3; // isGreater is true Less Than (<): Checks if
one value is less than another. var isLess = 4 < 10; // isLess is true Logical
Operators: These operators are used to combine or negate Boolean values. Logical
AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true. var result = true && false; //
result is false Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
javascript Copy code var result = true || false; // result is true Logical NOT
(!): Negates the Boolean value. var result = !true; // result is false
Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables.
Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable. javascript Copy code var x = 10;
// x is assigned the value 10 Addition Assignment (+=): Adds and assigns a value
to a variable. var x = 5; x += 3; // x is now 8 Subtraction Assignment (-=):
Subtracts and assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10; x -= 2; // x is now 8
Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies and assigns a value to a variable.
var x = 4; x *= 3; // x is now 12 Division Assignment (/=): Divides and assigns
a value to a variable. var x = 20; x /= 4; // x is now 5
